# Learning Notes

The following is a curated collection of notes, insights, and resources from my ongoing journey in machine learning, generative AI, and finance. 

These notes were originally written for personal reference during my studies or my full-time role from October 2023 to October 2024. As such, they may not always be exhaustive or fully accurate. They serve as quick, practical references and should be cross-referenced with more detailed sources where needed.
